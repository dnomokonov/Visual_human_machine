The window should contain ten buttons that occupy the left third of the window, and a colored rectangle that occupies the right two thirds of the window. Certain colors are assigned to the buttons and when you click on the button, the rectangle is colored in the color assigned to the button. The names of the colors in which the rectangle is painted should be written on the buttons.
