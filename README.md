## [Homework #1. Class diagrams](Homework-num-1-Class-diagrams/)
Implement a class diagram in the C# programming language and write a program demonstrating the work of classes from the diagram.

## [Homework #2. Application with a graphical interface](Homework-2-AvaloniaColor/)
Implement an application with a graphical interface consisting of a single window. The window should contain ten buttons that occupy the left third of the window, and a colored rectangle that occupies the right two thirds of the window. Certain colors are assigned to the buttons and when you click on the button, the rectangle is colored in the color assigned to the button. The names of the colors in which the rectangle is painted should be written on the buttons.

## [Homework #3. The binding mechanism](Homework-3-CalcApp/)
Implement a calculator in the C# programming language using the Avalonia framework.

## [Homework #4. Displaying collections](Homework-4-Explorer/)
Implement an application to view the file system. The application window should display a list of files and directories in the working directory.

## [Homework #5. Asynchrony in C#](Homework-5-ImprovedFileExplorer/)
Implement an application for viewing images based on homework No. 4.</br>
1. Implementation of asynchronous loading of the file system tree</br>
2. Implementation of displaying file system changes when it is changed outside the application
(you can use the FileSystemWatcher class)

## [Homework #6. WeatherApp](Homework-6-WeatherApp/)
Applicationem ad effectum deducendi videre tempestas praenuntientur aliquot diebus ante. Ut notitia, Uti OpenWeather officium.

## [Homework #7. Reactive programming](Homework-7-Reactive/)
Implement a factory that accepts an ObservableCollection object and returns an IObservable<NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs> â€” a list of event arguments Inotifycollectionchanged for the transferred collection. Write a console program demonstrating the operation of the factory. In the program, it is necessary to pass as a subscriber a method that logs data about changes to a file.
